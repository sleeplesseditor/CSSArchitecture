# Advanced React

An example of Advanced Front-end and React practices, as influenced by Franz Kati's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-for-senior-engineers).

The repo requires the [yarn package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to be installed and can be set up by running the following command:

```
yarn
```
