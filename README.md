# Frontend and React Practices

An example of Advanced Front-end and React practices, as influenced by Franz Kati's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-for-senior-engineers), and as a review of that course.

The repo requires the [yarn package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to be installed and can be set up by running the following command:

```
yarn
```

Ongoing issues have been identified with the scripts created as part of the course, but a solution has yet to be found due to lack of course support and obtuse documentation.
